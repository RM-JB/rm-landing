This repository contains all the assets to create full and responsive landing pages on the RMATVMC website.

Here are different usaes and variations on the styles provided in this repository.

Add this to the blank page to get things started:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RM-JB/rm-landing@main/rm-landing.css">
    <div id="rm-landing">

    </div>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RM-JB/rm-landing@main/rm-landing-script.js"></script>

  - All page content will go inside the div#rm-landing" tag
  - If you need to add extra styles to any particular page, add a <style> tag after the <link> tag and place in the custom styles there (or use inline styling).

    • Be sure to use specific style tags. As a standard add #rm-landing before each element.
